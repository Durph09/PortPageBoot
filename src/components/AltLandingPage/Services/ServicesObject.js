        Converting a WordPress site to a modern React/JS stack, while still
        using WordPress as a headless CMS, provides a number of significant
        advantages:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance:</strong> React and modern JavaScript frameworks
          provide an exceptional user experience due to their high performance.
          This can lead to better conversion rates as page loading speeds are
          critical for user engagement and SEO [1].
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility:</strong> When WordPress is used as a headless
          CMS, it separates the back-end from the front-end. This gives
          developers the freedom to build the front-end using modern
          technologies like React.js, which offers more control over the user
          interface and allows the creation of highly interactive web
          applications [2].
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> React/JS applications can handle high
          traffic and grow with your business needs, thanks to their
          component-based architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> React.js is known for
          its capability to create web applications that work seamlessly across
          different devices and browsers, enhancing the overall user experience
          [2].
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security:</strong> By using WordPress as a headless CMS, the
          surface area for potential attacks can be significantly reduced as the
          front-end is decoupled from the back-end.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Future-Proof:</strong> Adopting a modern tech stack ensures
          that your website stays up-to-date with the latest advancements in web
          technologies, making it future-proof and more sustainable in the long
          run.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Significantly enhance site performance, flexibility, scalability, and
        security, all while ensuring a great user experience.

      <h1>Comprehensive Website Management and Maintenance Services</h1>
      <p>
        From content updates to major design overhauls, I'm equipped to handle
        your needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Website Management</h2>
      <p>
        Website management is an all-encompassing task that goes beyond mere
        content updates. It includes keeping your site technologically current,
        secure, and operating at peak performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Content Management</h2>
      <p>
        For example, content management is key to keeping your website relevant
        and engaging. I can help you with regular content updates, blog posts,
        or product descriptions, ensuring your site always has fresh, up-to-date
        information for your visitors.
      </p>

      <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
      <p>
        SEO is another critical aspect of site management. I can monitor your
        site's SEO performance and make necessary adjustments to improve your
        search engine ranking. This can lead to increased visibility, driving
        more organic traffic to your site.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        Security is paramount in today's digital world. I can ensure your
        website is protected from potential threats by regularly updating
        security protocols and monitoring for suspicious activity. This way,
        your website, and your customer's information, stay safe.
      </p>

      <h2>E-commerce Support</h2>
      <p>
        If you run an e-commerce site, updating products and managing inventory
        can be time-consuming. I can take this off your plate by managing your
        product listings, updating prices, and ensuring inventory levels are
        accurately reflected on your site.
      </p>

      <h2>Flexible Pricing Options</h2>
      <p>
        To provide the best value and service, I offer flexible pricing options.
        For ongoing support, consider a monthly retainer, ideal for businesses
        needing consistent, high-quality website maintenance. This includes all
        necessary updates and adjustments to keep your site running smoothly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, for one-off projects or less frequent updates, a
        fixed-price agreement may be more suitable. We can discuss your needs
        and agree on a fair price for the project, providing clarity and
        confidence in the cost upfront.
